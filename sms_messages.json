Flooding in basements or otherwise is unheard of in our neighborhood. Do we need that?\n\n2) why the early signing seven day? We absolutely want to have this in place no later than 11/28 so I'm concerned about that and want to know more about the seven day delay. \n\nThank you! I love the video and communication so far.",
