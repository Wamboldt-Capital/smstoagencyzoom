Message:
I just had a meeting canceled so I was able to take a look. I wrote you back via email. It looks like the auto policy was able to be reduced significantly. Almost $4000. I'm just wondering if that's accurate and what I'm missing? I don't see that the coverage has changed at all. If you have time for a call, let me know.

Thanks, Tylor. I will take a look in a little while and get back to you. Once I have a chance to look at it, I will schedule some time to discuss.
